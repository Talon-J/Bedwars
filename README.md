# Bedwars


This plugin is a project started for private usage, experience and learning. We don't plan to commercialize this project.

We're a team of junior programmers working on a Bedwars plugin. The purpose of the project is simply to replicate Hypixel Bedwars to the best of our ability (Minus minor details which won't change the game). Please do not expect the code to be perfect: There are probably a million and 1 hidden bugs we don't know about. 
Yes, we do try to make things as best as we can, and do strive for quality, but we're not professional; We've only been familiar with java for about 1-3 years, and this plugin is really just for experience and learning, so constructive criticism and suggestions are greatly encouraged.
